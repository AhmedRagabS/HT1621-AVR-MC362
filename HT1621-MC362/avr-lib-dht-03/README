The DHT11/22 are a basic, low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensors.
They uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding
air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed).
Compared to the DHT11, DHT22 is more precise, more accurate and works in a bigger
range of temperature/humidity.
This library use DHT11/22 sensor to read temperature and humidity on Atmega micro.
Setup the data port connected to the micro pin in file dht.h


Devel Notes
